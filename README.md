# Sign Language Recognition using Neural Network

Sign Language Recognition using Neural Network is an artificial intelligence project that predicts sign language gestures using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology. The system processes still images through computer vision methods, including conversion to grayscale, development, and activity coverage. The CNN architecture is employed to classify and interpret the images, achieving high accuracy in recognizing 24 American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets.

## Features
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Utilizes a deep learning model for image classification and recognition.
- **Grayscale Transformation:** Converts input images to grayscale to enhance feature extraction.
- **Activity Coverage:** Includes methods for handling movement and dynamic aspects of sign language gestures.
- **American Sign Language (ASL):** Recognizes and predicts 24 ASL alphabets with high accuracy.
- **Accuracy Metrics:** The model achieves an accuracy of above 98.77% with an epoch rate of 35.

## Technologies Used
- **Neural Network:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- **Python:** Core programming language for developing the neural network model.
- **Computer Vision Libraries:** Utilizes computer vision methods for image preprocessing and analysis.

## Model Training
The model is trained on a dataset of still images representing American Sign Language gestures. Training involves multiple epochs, and the model is fine-tuned to achieve a high level of accuracy. The architecture and hyperparameters are optimized for efficient sign language recognition.

## Results
The model has been evaluated on a test dataset, demonstrating an accuracy of above 98.77%. Results and performance metrics are documented in the project report.
